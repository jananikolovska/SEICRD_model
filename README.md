SEIRCD represents a general model that can be used to predict the course of any infectious disease. Based on predefined parameters, the model can determine the state of the population or, in our case, the state of each member of a given population at a specific time unit. The parameters we will use are statistical values taken from the current COVID-19 pandemic. Using this model, we can observe differences in the development of the virus with changes in parameters and draw conclusions about which parameter values will contribute to the slowest development of the disease as possible interventions for managing the pandemic. The model is implemented on a network generated using the Lancichinetti–Fortunato–Radicchi benchmark algorithm. More details can be found in Документација.pdf.
